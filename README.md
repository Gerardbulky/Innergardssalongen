[Project's Wireframe](https://github.com/gerardambe/Innergardssalongen/files/4183052/New.Project.2.pdf)


## FEATURES
* I incorporated the [Navbar Dropdown menu](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/navbar/) into my site from bootstrap together with [JS link](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/) for my dropdown menu. The navbar is responsive and collapse into a hamburger menu icon at 575px,the size of a mobile version.
* I plan on using the signup Form control feature in bootstrap where users can be registered to the site to get discounts or other informations in the future.


### FEATURES LEFT TO IMPLEMENT
 I would like in the future to implement an online booking feature into the site,where users can see for theselves what time is free and what time is already booked without having to call.

 ## TECHNOLOGIES USED
* Html
* Css
* [JS](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/) in Boostrap 4 to simplify the manipulation of the navbar.

### TESTING
With this project the user would be able to achieve their goals with the following informations.The Navigation bar contains,
* Location button,which when clicked will provide the location of the salon to the user.
* Services button,which when click opens as a dropdown,providing informations to the user about the services rendered and what to expect.
* A BOOK NOW button which also collapse into the hamburger menu icon on the mobile versions at 575px.This contains a BOOK NOW! Button to the user when clicked makes a call for a booking appointment.
* Futhermore there is an image of the owner which takes 50% the size of the screen when viewed on desk top and full width on mobil devices for users to know who to meet.
* Contact Informations,provides additional informations obout the opening and closing hours,Location and mobile contact. it takes 50% when viewed on desktops and full width on mobil devices.
* Gallary,provides a summary of some hairstyles to the users and the profesionality of what to expect.
* Footer,has social icons which when clicked will open into a new tap because i used (target="_blank"),redirecting the user on other social media websites.

The site has been tested on several browsers and mobil devices such as (Note 3,Galaxy s5,Iphone 6/7/8,Ipad etc) and was found to be responsive.The social links icons didn't stay on thesame line in some mobil devices such as Pixel 2 but with {whitespace: no-wrap} on my inline-block class,i was able to get them all in thesame line,responding and responsive.

### CONTENT 

All the content information was done by me.for example,when hovering on the Navbar content,will give you a Wobble Horizontal effect and the BOOK NOW button also has a GROW effect. The MAKE AN APPOINTMENT has a FORWARD effect when hovering over.

The services menu shows the different services to be expected by the user.The location provides the address location and the book now button makes a call.

On the footer,the social links have a hover effect which changes to orange when hovered upon and will redirect the user to other social media websites,which opens into another tab.
### MEDIA 

All the photos used from on this site was given to me by the person from whom i intended building this site for.
